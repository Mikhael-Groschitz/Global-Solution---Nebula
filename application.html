            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>The Wave Line Magnet boasts a versatile and scalable design, carefully crafted to harness the power of ocean waves across diverse environments and weather conditions. This groundbreaking technology offers an extensive range of applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean Desalinated Water:</strong> Addressing the global need for freshwater, the Wave Line Magnet produces clean, desalinated water, essential for communities worldwide. Its desalination capability meets demands for potable water in areas where water resources are scarce.</li>
                <li><strong>Electricity Production:</strong> Leveraging its mechanical power, the device generates electricity efficiently and sustainably, contributing to renewable energy solutions. Its modular presence allows adaptation to different energy generation demands, from small isolated systems to large-scale ocean energy parks.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen Production:</strong> Beyond electricity, the Wave Line Magnet has the potential to produce hydrogen, paving the way for clean fuel production. This capability has promising applications in sectors such as transportation, energy storage, and industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Erosion Prevention:</strong> The phenomenon of coastal erosion poses a significant challenge to coastal communities worldwide. The Wave Line Magnet's unique interaction with waves allows it to dampen wave force in a controlled manner, reducing coastal erosion. Additionally, its mechanical power generation capacity can be utilized to strengthen coastal infrastructures and boost local economic activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid Connection and Off-Grid Solutions:</strong> The flexibility of the Wave Line Magnet allows for direct connection to the electrical grid or the provision of autonomous solutions in remote regions or islands. This adaptability ensures a stable energy supply, even in isolated locations, contributing to sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish Farming:</strong> In addition to its energy applications, the Wave Line Magnet can be employed in fish farming, providing a conducive environment for aquaculture development. This combination of renewable energy and aquaculture represents an integrated approach to the sustainable use of ocean resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Desalination</h2>
            <p>The constant demand for potable water drives the need for accessible and efficient desalination solutions. The Wave Line Magnet demonstrates its effectiveness by producing drinking water from seawater, using its mechanical energy to drive onboard desalination processes. This capability is particularly crucial in arid and remote regions where access to potable water is limited.</p>
            <h2>Electricity Generation</h2>
            <p>The Wave Line Magnet's ability to convert wave energy into electricity marks a milestone in renewable energy production. Its versatile and efficient design allows for implementation in a variety of scenarios, from off-grid energy systems to large-scale ocean energy parks. Additionally, its adaptability makes it a viable solution for remote areas and isolated communities.</p>
            <h2>Coastal Erosion Prevention</h2>
            <p>Coastal erosion is a growing challenge in many coastal regions worldwide. The Wave Line Magnet offers an innovative approach to mitigate this issue by dampening wave force and reducing the effects of coastal erosion. Simultaneously, its ability to generate mechanical energy can be utilized to strengthen coastal structures and promote local economic development.</p>
